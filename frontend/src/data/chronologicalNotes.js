The coordinator also came to offer her this appointment, easy to access, to talk with a doctor about her symptoms, (as mentioned since the beginning of February) who has test or analysis results to communicate to her. Mrs. still refuses to get up. We are telling her that this is indeed her choice, but also that in this case, she will not be able to ask for someone to go with her and wait in the emergency room",
